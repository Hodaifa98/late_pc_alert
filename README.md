# Night Owl Alert
This small Python script is designed to help develop healthy sleep habits by reminding the user to shut down their computer after a specific hour.

**Note:** Currently, this script plays alert sounds using the winsound library. So the sound works in Windows only at the moment.

### Prerequisites:

Python 3

winsound library

### Usage:

Either run the script using python main.py.

Or add as a startup service (Task Scheduler in Windows as an example).

### Contributing
Feel free to modify the script to suit your needs. 

You can also contribute by adding functionalities like screen brightness control or cross-platform sound play.
